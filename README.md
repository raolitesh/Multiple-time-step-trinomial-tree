This project is based on the paper written by Paul Clifford and Oleg Zaboronski titled Pricing Options
using Trinomial Trees dated 17.11.2008. It is an extension of Binomial model that we used earlier to price
the call option. We will see that in addition of up and down movements in stock price in time $T = t+1$ over
$T = t$ , we consider the possibility of stock price remains same. So, in this trinomial model we have three
branches, one for each scenario i.e. up, down, and same. In this project we explore the idea of trinomial
model to price the call option , and we see that if we increase the number of time steps to maturity to a
significant number, then it converges to Black-Scholes model.
